<h3>Special characters</h3>
<p>
	Gallery should work with all possible special characters in UTF-8. In this folder are created some files and folers named by
	<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia - Pangram">pangrams</a> to test it out even in your browser (and backend server, of course).
</p>
<h3>Nice URL</h3>
<p>
	For most of folders URL in browser address bar is showing nice, just like in breadcrumb below.
	But if you copy URL from address bar, it probably get's escaped to percents (I call it <i>ugly URL</i>)<br>
	Solution: use "Share" button to copy
	<i>nice URL</i> which should work as good as that ugly but it is much more readable if you paste it on your favourite social network or communication app.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Spaces are in adress bar by default always escaped with %20, which is, again, ugly. So gallery is replacing them with + (plus) character.<br>
	If there is plus sign in folder/file name, it gets escaped with \ (backslash).
