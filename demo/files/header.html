	<b>Image</b>: after image full load, it will wait 5 seconds (adjustable in settings) and then go to next file<br>
	<b>Video</b>: after video load, it will start playing the video. As soon as video will stop, it will go to next file.<br>
	<b>Audio</b>: the same as video<br>
	<b>Any other file</b>: still in @TODO

	If it hits end, presentation mode will stop.
