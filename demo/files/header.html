<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>
	Presentation mode can be started or stopped via <i class="fa fa-play-circle"></i> button in popup, which appears when a file is opened. It will automatically go to the next file, and the behavior depends on the file type:<br>
	<b>Image</b>: after the image is loaded, gallery will wait 5 seconds (adjustable in settings) and then go to the next file<br>
	<b>Video</b>: after the video is loaded, it will be played. As soon as the video stops, gallery will go to the next file.<br>
	<b>Audio</b>: behaves just like video<br>
	<b>Any other file</b>: still in @TODO
</p>
<p>
	After displaying the last file, presentation mode will stop.
