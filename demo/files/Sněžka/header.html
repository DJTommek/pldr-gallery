<p>
	Trip to the highest mountain in Czechia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sn%C4%9B%C5%BEka">Sněžka</a> in the Krkonoše mountains.

<h3>EXIF and map</h3>
<p>
	Here you can test map generated from EXIF info loaded from every file in this folder.
</p>
<h3>Data saving</h3>
<p>
	There are also pretty big files in this folder so it is great to test "Data saving" feature in the settings.<br>
	Basically it just resize image to maximum dimensions 1024 x 1024 (by default). If you want to show file in original size even with "Data saving" feature enabled, just open file into popup and click on <i class="fa fa-download"></i> button.
