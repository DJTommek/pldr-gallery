	<h3>pldrGallery</h3>
	<p>
		<b>pldrGallery</b> is web application to browse files focused on viewing images and videos on custom private servers.
		Originaly it started just as simple <a href="https://github.com/DJTommek/minPHPgallery" target="_blank" title="Github - minPHPgallery">PHP script</a>
		but as time was flowing, I was searching for more robust solution and pldrGallery was born!
	</p>
	<p>
		Basic goal is to <b>not give</b> gigabytes of your personal media files from holidays to public servers,
		but keep them on your own computer with ability to share them to anyone out in the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		All tested galeries were creating thumbnails and indexes, didn't care about security or simply didnt't work with so much collected data.<br>
		When I started this project, my family gallery was about 500 GB big with ~80 000 files and ~1200 folders and I knew it will be counting.
	</p>
