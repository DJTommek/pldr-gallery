<div style="max-width: 900px; margin:0 auto; text-align: justify">
	<h3>pldrGallery</h3>
	<p>
		<b>pldrGallery</b> is web application for file browsing that focuses on viewing images and videos on custom private servers. Originaly it started just as a simple PHP script
		<a href="https://github.com/DJTommek/minPHPgallery" target="_blank" title="Github - minPHPgallery">minPHPgallery  <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>,
		but as time was flowing, I was looking for a more robust solution and <a href="https://github.com/DJTommek/pldr-gallery" target="_blank" title="Github - pldrGallery">pldrGallery <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> was born!
	</p>
	<p>
		The basic goal is to
		<b>not give</b>
		gigabytes of your personal media files and pictures from holidays to public servers, but keep them on your own computer, while keeping the ability to share them with anyone out in the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		All other gallery projects that I found
		<b>requiring</b>
		to creating thumbnails and indexes, didn't care about security or simply didnt't work with so much collected data:
		in my case it's <b>~2 000</b> folders with <b>~110 000</b> files of total <b>~850</b> GB.<br>
	</p>
