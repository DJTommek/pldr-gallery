	<h3>pldrGallery</h3>
	<p>
		<b>pldrGallery</b> is web application for file browsing that focuses on viewing images and videos on custom private servers.
		Originaly it started just as a simple <a href="https://github.com/DJTommek/minPHPgallery" target="_blank" title="Github - minPHPgallery">PHP script</a>,
		but as time was flowing, I was looking for a more robust solution and pldrGallery was born!
	</p>
	<p>
		The basic goal is to <b>not give</b> gigabytes of your personal media files and pictures from holidays to public servers,
		but keep them on your own computer, while keeping the ability to share them with anyone out in the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		All gallery projects that I found were creating thumbnails and indexes, didn't care about security or simply didnt't work with so much collected data.<br>
		When I started this project, my family gallery was about 500 GB big with ~80 000 files and ~1200 folders and I knew it will be growing.
	</p>
