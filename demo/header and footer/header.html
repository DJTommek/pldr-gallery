<h3>Demo header</h3>
<p>
	If you want to have this "greeting" text on the top of a loaded structure, just place a
	<b>header.html</b> file in the folder and it will get automatically rendered into <b>div#structure-header</b>.<br>
	You can use any tags, entities, javascipt, csss, whatever, it is just up to you if you break your own page ;)<br>
	It works exactly the same for <b>footer.html</b>, which is rendered under the loaded structure into
	<b>div#structure-footer</b>.
