<h3>Demo header</h3>
<p>
	If you want to have this "greetings" text on the top of loaded structure, just place <b>header.html</b> file in the folder and it gets automatically rendered into <b>div#structure-header</b>.<br>
	You can use any tags, entities, javascipt, csss, whatever, it is just up to you if you broke your own page ;)<br>
	IT works exactly the same for <b>footer.html</b> which is rendered under loaded structure into <b>div#structure-footer</b>.
