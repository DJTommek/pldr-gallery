<p>
	Trip to the highest mountain in Czechia,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sn%C4%9B%C5%BEka">Sněžka</a> in the Krkonoše mountains + one extra video
	file to demonstrate, that location can be loaded from videos too.

<h3>EXIF and map</h3>
<p>
	Here you can test the map generated from EXIF info loaded from every file in this folder.
</p>
<h3>Data saving</h3>
<p>
	There are also pretty big files in this folder, so it is a good opportunity to test the "Data saving" feature from the settings.<br>
	Basically, it just scales the image to be smaller than 1024px in both dimensions (by default).
	If you want to show the original file even with "Data saving" enabled, just open it and click the
	<i class="fa fa-download"></i> button in the popup.
