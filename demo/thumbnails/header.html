<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
<p>
	You can switch between three possible view of item in folder: 
	<span class="badge badge-secondary"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-th-list"></i> Rows</span>
	<span class="badge badge-secondary"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-th"></i> Small tiles</span>
	and
	<span class="badge badge-secondary"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-th-large"></i> Big tiles</span> below.
</p>
</p>
	For tiles view are generated small thumbnails to quick view of file content (currently images only).<br>
	Thumbnails are generated also for folders if there is enough files, that can be file thumbnails - this can be overriden with creating file "thumbnail.png".
