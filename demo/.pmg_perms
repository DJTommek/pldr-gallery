## Example users permissions file ##
# 'x' is non-logged user. 
# If is user logged, User permissions (if has any) are merged with these from user 'x'
# Rules: 
# - lines starting with # are ignored
# - user is written as email address provided from Google login
# - permission has to start with space and slash after that
# - use only POSIX paths (without backward slashes), no dynamic paths
# - after section (user + permissions) has to be blank line

# allow some folders to everyone
